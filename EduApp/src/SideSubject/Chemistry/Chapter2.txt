## Atomic Structure
- Matter is made up of atoms, consisting of protons, neutrons, and electrons.
- Atomic number = number of protons; Mass number = protons + neutrons.
- Electrons occupy energy levels (shells) around the nucleus.

## Chemical Bonds
- Ionic Bonds: Transfer of electrons between atoms (metal + non-metal).
- Covalent Bonds: Sharing of electrons between atoms (non-metal + non-metal).
- Metallic Bonds: Delocalized electrons in metals.
- Hydrogen Bonds: Weak interaction, important in water and biological molecules.

## Chemical Reactions
- Reactants transform into products.
- Law of Conservation of Mass: Mass is neither created nor destroyed.
- Reaction types: combination, decomposition, displacement, redox.

## Periodic Table
- Elements arranged by increasing atomic number.
- Groups: Columns with similar chemical properties.
- Periods: Rows representing energy levels.

## States of Matter
- Solids, liquids, gases, and plasma.
- Phase changes: melting, freezing, condensation, vaporization, sublimation.

## Summary
A strong grasp of atomic theory, bonding, reactions, and the periodic table forms the foundation of chemistry.
