# Chapter 1: Introduction to Computer Science

## What is Computer Science?
Computer Science (CS) is the systematic study of computational systems, algorithms, data structures, and how information is processed. 
It combines theoretical foundations with practical applications like software engineering, networking, databases, and artificial intelligence.

## History of Computing
- Early mechanical calculators and devices.
- 19th-century concepts of general-purpose computing.
- 20th-century electronic computers: vacuum tubes → transistors → integrated circuits.
- Modern computing includes programming languages, operating systems, AI, and more.

## Why Study Computer Science?
- Solve real-world problems efficiently.
- Build software, web services, and data-driven applications.
- Understand algorithms and data structures for optimal problem-solving.

## Core Concepts
- **Algorithm**: step-by-step procedure to solve a problem.
- **Data Structure**: organization of data for efficient access (arrays, lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, hash tables).

## Programming Fundamentals
- Express algorithms in a language the computer can execute.
- Handle input/output, conditions, loops, and manage data.

## Summary
Computer Science blends theory and practice to create solutions, tools, and systems that transform data into knowledge.
