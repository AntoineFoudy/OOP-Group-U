# Chapter 3: Introduction to Java

## Why Java?
- Java is cross-platform, object-oriented, and widely used.
- Write once, run anywhere using the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
- Ideal for desktop, web, mobile, and enterprise applications.

## Java Syntax and Structure
- Programs are structured as **classes**.
- Entry point: `main` method.
- Strongly typed language; type safety enforced at compile-time.

## Classes and Objects
- **Class**: blueprint for creating objects.
- **Object**: instance of a class, with state (fields) and behavior (methods).
- Supports encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

## Inheritance and Interfaces
- Inheritance: subclass inherits fields/methods from superclass.
- Interfaces define contracts for classes to implement, promoting abstraction.

## Exception Handling
- Use `try`, `catch`, `finally` for errors.
- Checked vs unchecked exceptions distinguish recoverable from runtime errors.

## Java Standard Libraries
- Collections, I/O, networking, concurrency, data structures, utilities.
- Libraries save development time and provide tested, optimized functionality.

## Java Use Cases
- Desktop apps, web servers (servlets), Android apps, enterprise backends, scientific computing.

## Summary
Java is a robust, portable, object-oriented language suitable for building simple or complex applications.
