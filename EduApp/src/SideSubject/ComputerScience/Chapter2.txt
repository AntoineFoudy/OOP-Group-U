# Chapter 2: Fundamentals of Programming

## Basics of Programming
Programming allows us to translate logical flows into instructions for a computer. 
Key concepts include: variables, data types (integer, float, string, boolean), operators, expressions, and input/output.

## Control Flow
- **Conditionals**: if, else, switch
- **Loops**: for, while, do-while
- Control flow ensures programs respond correctly to different inputs.

## Functions and Modularity
- Functions group related statements under a name.
- Parameters and return values enable reusability and abstraction.
- Improves readability and modular design.

## Error Handling and Debugging
- Errors: syntax, runtime, logic.
- Use debugging, testing, and exception handling to ensure reliability.

## Intro to Data Structures
- Arrays, Lists, Stacks, Queues.
- Organize data efficiently to improve program performance.

## Best Practices
- Meaningful variable names, comments, and proper formatting.
- Avoid code duplication; write modular, readable code.

## Summary
Programming fundamentals form the foundation for software development and advanced CS topics.
