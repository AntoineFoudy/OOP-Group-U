## Types of Chemical Reactions
1. Synthesis (Combination): A + B → AB
2. Decomposition: AB → A + B
3. Single Displacement: A + BC → AC + B
4. Double Displacement: AB + CD → AD + CB
5. Combustion: Hydrocarbon + O2 → CO2 + H2O

## Balancing Chemical Equations
- Ensure number of atoms on reactants = products.
- Use coefficients to balance the equation.
- Practice is key to mastering balancing.

## Acids, Bases, and pH
- Acid: Releases H+ ions in water (e.g., HCl).
- Base: Releases OH- ions in water (e.g., NaOH).
- pH scale: Measures acidity/alkalinity (0-14), 7 = neutral.

## Energy in Reactions
- Exothermic: Releases energy (e.g., combustion).
- Endothermic: Absorbs energy (e.g., photosynthesis).
- Activation energy: Minimum energy required for reaction.

## Catalysts
- Substances that speed up reactions without being consumed.
- Examples: Enzymes in biological reactions, metal catalysts in industry.

## Summary
Understanding reaction types, energy changes, and pH is essential to study and apply chemistry in real-world scenarios.
