## What is Chemistry?
Chemistry is the scientific study of matter, its properties, composition, and the changes it undergoes. 
It connects physics, biology, and environmental sciences to explain natural phenomena.

## Branches of Chemistry
- Organic Chemistry: Study of carbon-containing compounds.
- Inorganic Chemistry: Study of minerals, metals, and non-carbon compounds.
- Physical Chemistry: Focus on the physical principles governing chemical systems.
- Analytical Chemistry: Techniques to analyze substances.
- Biochemistry: Chemical processes in living organisms.

## Importance of Chemistry
- Understanding chemical reactions helps in pharmaceuticals, agriculture, and materials science.
- Chemistry enables innovation in energy, sustainability, and technology.
- Everyday life applications: cooking, cleaning, medicine, and industrial production.

## Safety in Chemistry
- Use protective equipment: gloves, goggles, lab coats.
- Follow proper disposal and storage procedures.
- Never mix chemicals without understanding the reaction.

## Summary
Chemistry provides tools and knowledge to understand and manipulate matter safely and efficiently.
